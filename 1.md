The frustrating aspect (contemplating exercises or learning new material) is that if all computations and thought processes are performed purely mentally, the cognitive load becomes excessively high. This severely impacts the brain's processing speed, acting like a CPU bottleneck. However, while utilizing external aids (like verbalizing or manual calculations) reduces this overhead, it doesn't offer the same seamless flow as an entirely internal process.

Sometimes negative feedback can be more effective than positive feedback.

And sometimes, allowing the system to develop freely yields better results than adding feedback (whether positive or negative).

The world around us has changed, but we ourselves remain unchanged.

It is well-known that mobile phones are private and personal spaces. In contrast, workplace computers are inherently public. Therefore, it is essential to set up dedicated social media accounts on work computer to maintain a clean and transparent information output.

I think that providing concrete examples before introducing a generalized abstract definition should be easier to accept than directly introducing the abstract definition and then explaining with concrete examples.

Of course, I understand that starting with the abstract definition can initially bewilder readers, which might then spark their curiosity, and this could potentially help stimulate their interest in understanding the examples later.

So you can see that even for such simple and natural sentences in Chinese, it is still quite difficult for me to express them in English.

This actually made me suddenly realize that perhaps the brain, like the muscles of our limbs, shares some basic functional modules. Therefore, using stimulating, high-intensity but simple exercises could very likely have a very significant basic optimization effect on performing highly complex combined tasks.

As you can see, the formula module in Feishu Docs is not actually designed for professional math input. It is just there to help insert a small number of formulas naturally into certain notes, so the author doesn't have to worry about those minor formula input issues.

At that moment, I thought that if I could radiate light, I could naturally guide others in the right direction.

The brightest, the darkest. Endure pain, achieve evolution.

I think that before ChatGPT receives user instructions and system prompts, there is also a more deeply embedded system prompt inserted by OpenAI.

Everyone knows that many delicate and beautiful things can be abstracted into a concise and natural structure. Artistic creation, like pure mathematics, when viewed in parts, seems to have ordinary details. Yet, by organizing a large number of ordinary details through a naturally flowing structure,combined with astonishing attention, one can create many great and extraordinary works.

Many things are not because we did them wrong, but because we haven't done them well enough.

I still consider myself a laid-back person who prefers the "lying flat" lifestyle, but not someone who wallows in defeat. I simply want to reach an elevated position where my inner light becomes bright enough to illuminate life's darkness.

This is an ordinary formula, but I want to understand its deeper aspects.

Just like when you start playing badminton, tracking the shuttlecock's flight path can quickly drain your mental energy, making you feel pain and unable to focus. Everything is difficult at the beginning, and only through diligent practice can become strong.

I just want to show that I'm not actually worse than anyone else. Anything others have, I can have as well. I couldn't tolerate the darkness in the first place—especially that I've seen true light.

Take the elevator from the third floor down to the first floor, then take the escalator from the first floor up to the second floor. Then, after walking to the Burger King in the mall and finishing my hamburger, take the emergency exit stairs up to the fourth floor to watch a movie.

More shipping less talking.

[Suddenly remembered that my phone’s battery is low] muttering to myself:  “Then I think I should charge my phone, right?” [Recalling that the battery health on my old phone is only about 60%] so I figure that this phone ('s battery) is essentially finished.

The dormant blood within me has been ignited once again by dreams!

Sometimes, because the problem is too difficult to solve, I can’t get any positive feedback right away. At such times, I instinctively want to switch to something simpler that offers immediate positive feedback. But that’s a mistake. If I give up solving the problem just because it’s difficult and I can’t get immediate positive feedback, I’ll never make any truly meaningful progress.

Yes, yes, but I always feel that’s not really good. I want to be someone who always appears calm and untroubled, free from worldly cares, and filled with joy at the world’s beauty.

If we are willing to work hard for our beautiful dreams, the world will always offer us crucial help at some point.

When you feel bored while working diligently, the first thing you should do isn’t to seek amusement in that boredom—such as scrolling through short videos or reading fragmented posts—but rather to relax your mind, for example by daydreaming or resting your eyes, or even just going to sleep. Boredom arises because excessive fatigue generates too much negative feedback, whereas rest can quickly alleviate fatigue and, in turn, provide relatively more positive feedback.

I think probability theory and stochastic processes are indeed very useful. Someone who studies stochastic processes is actually rapidly deepening their profound understanding of the world.

You know, speaking your thoughts out loud can greatly reduce the mental burden. This essentially means that the mind only has to deal with the natural language logic and its output, while the rest of the work is handled automatically by the subconscious. However, it is obvious that in most public settings, speaking to oneself out loud is not permitted because it would affect others. Therefore, we must learn to construct and produce our words internally in our minds at the same time. This makes the mind very tired, and because it is working on two threads, I often feel a heavier burden than when expressing things aloud, and I sense that my thinking becomes less smooth and open.

As we all know, the higher we climb, the clearer our weaknesses become. Take language learning as an example: sometimes my proficiency is still quite low, far from meeting the demands of work and study. Consequently, I’m under pressure to quickly develop the basic skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. However, as we also know, I'm not particularly gifted in this area. Often, I feel like I am being forced into something beyond my current abilities, and the result is far from satisfactory.

It’s incredibly challenging to objectively assess our own level. Starting from the very basics is undoubtedly the most sensible approach, yet I’m constantly aiming to reach an advanced level that matches both practical needs and personal aspirations. This rush often interferes with seeing ourselves as we truly are.

Although if I start delving into Chapter 11 now—essentially the math foundations of Chapter 12—it will temporarily prevent me from thoroughly exploring Chapter 12, I actually find Chapter 12 quite easy, so there's no need to worry too much. All in all, it seems reasonable to grab breakfast first and then come back for a bit more study afterward.

When we approach the brightest light, we inevitably encounter the darkest evil in its shadow.

I think playing badminton is a great sport, similar to running and fitness. It's easy to get into and can enhance both mental and physical functions. (But the main reason I'm asking this to you is that my nephews play badminton, so I'd like to develop it as a shared hobby.

It has always been the case—past, present, and future—that I am a math student. No one claims that math students can't program, write code, and develop software.

Speaking of this, it actually goes back to my original motivation for learning Lean, which is to formalize mathematical proofs to make them absolutely rigorous. From this perspective, I think formalizing those elementary mathematical problems, such as some simple proofs in elementary number theory, real analysis, and linear algebra, is more in line with my personal interests.

I believe that the top priority is to urgently improve our mathematical foundation. Although AI can assist us in writing code, it can never instill mathematical definitions into our minds.

What exactly is passion? Passion is giving up other things you like for that one thing. When a person truly loves something, they will naturally choose to endure the pain of giving up [other things] and do what they truly desire to do.

When a person feels lonely, bored, lost, and finds it unbearable that their desires aren't immediately satisfied, what should they do?

Then, I received a stern ultimatum from the outside world. This was, of course, a notification that I should immediately extract myself, as quickly as possible, from what I was doing – something that was incredibly boring and severely overstaying my leisure time [though, I suppose, I should add that it wasn't *completely* pointless].

Now, I'm off to my graduate student workspace to study/work!

[Note: Here, "workspace" refers to the portion of the graduate office that each student occupies, including their own desk and chair.]

This seat has armrests on both sides, so you can naturally support your arms and elbows on them. Therefore, I think this chair is quite comfortable.

A lazy person who plans to reap without sowing and enjoy the fruits of others' labor will never have their vile desires fulfilled by heaven and earth. If some people always refuse to endure hardship, delight in trickery and shortcuts, yet still want to benefit from others' efforts, then we should send them to hell—its environment is perfectly suited for them.

Dreams and the better world belong only to those who are willing to invest wisdom and labor, turning the unimaginable into reality.

Counting on that empty promise, you'll be waiting forever. My assessment is that even if it happens, it will be when pigs fly, and by then everything will have changed. Whether the promise will be the same as originally offered, or if you can even get it at all, is highly questionable. We should firmly grasp the current opportunities while doing our own responsibilities as well as possible - that's the correct strategy.

Well, what I want to say is that those who aim to achieve great things should not always envy others' phased successes. When we commit to doing something, we can succeed, and we never fear failure or become anxious and disheartened because of it. This is what is known as the confidence of the strong.

Don't just focus on short-term, minor calculations or immediate benefits. We need to calculate for the long term, incorporating development trends and future vision – look at the bigger picture. Temporary gains and losses are fleeting; don't let petty calculations disrupt the overall strategy.
