# Idea Management and Visualization

## The Value of Human Thought
In the future, human ideas and questions will become extremely valuable data. Beyond everyday habits and action logs that often go unnoticed, the most critical product of human attention is the generation of ideas and questions.

## Visualization Strategy
To effectively manage these thoughts, a tree structure should be employed, balancing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) patterns. This approach allows for:
- **Hierarchical organization**: Visualizing thoughts logically.
- **Efficient navigation**: Moving between high-level concepts and deep details easily.
