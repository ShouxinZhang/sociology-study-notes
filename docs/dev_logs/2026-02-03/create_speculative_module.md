# Development Log - Create Speculative Deep Dives Module

**Date:** 2026-02-03 14:45:00 (Simulated time)

## Changes
- Created new directory `notes/Speculative_Deep_Dives/` to house experimental and "hazy" philosophical inquiries.
- Created the first note in this module: `Intrinsic_Human_Differentiation.md`.
    - **Topic**: A thought experiment on "The Reset" — what distinguishes humans if all external status is stripped away?
    - **Content**: Synthesized the user's raw thoughts into a structured hypothesis about "Internal Capital" (Cognitive, Disciplinary, Embodied).
    - **Update**: Translated the content to Chinese as per user request.
- Updated `docs/architecture/repository-structure.md` to reflect the new module.

## Motivation (Business Value)
This module addresses the need for an "incubator" for ideas that are not yet fully formed academic theories or personal logs. It provides a dedicated space for `Speculative_Deep_Dives`, ensuring that valuable but ambiguous thoughts are captured and given room to evolve through discussion and reflection.
